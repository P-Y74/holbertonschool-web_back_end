# Python - Async Comprehension

This project focuses on asynchronous generators and async comprehensions in Python. You will learn how to write asynchronous generators, use async comprehensions effectively, and properly type-annotate asynchronous generators.

---

## üöÄ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Write asynchronous generators in Python.
- Use async comprehensions to handle asynchronous iteration concisely.
- Apply type annotations to asynchronous generators and coroutines.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- All Python files must:
  - Begin with the shebang line: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - End with a newline.
  - Be executable.
  - Comply with `pycodestyle` style guidelines (version 2.5.x).
  - Include meaningful documentation for all modules, functions, and coroutines.
  - Use type annotations for all functions and coroutines.

- Environment:
  - All code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
  - Python version: 3.9.

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
