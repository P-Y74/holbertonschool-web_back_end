# Python Advanced Concepts

This repository contains projects exploring advanced and essential Python concepts focused on type safety and asynchronous programming. These projects are designed to strengthen your understanding of Pythonâ€™s type annotations and asynchronous capabilities, crucial for writing clean, robust, and efficient modern Python code.

---

## Projects Overview

### 1. Python - Variable Annotations

Learn how to use type annotations in Python 3 to specify function signatures and variable types, understand duck typing, and validate code with `mypy`. This project builds a strong foundation in Pythonâ€™s static typing capabilities to improve code readability and reliability.

**Key Topics:**

- Type annotations for variables and functions  
- Duck typing principles  
- Static type checking with `mypy`  

---

### 2. Python - Async

Explore asynchronous programming in Python with `async` and `await` syntax. Understand how to execute async programs using `asyncio`, run concurrent coroutines, create asyncio tasks, and utilize the `random` module within asynchronous contexts.

**Key Topics:**

- `async` and `await` syntax  
- Running asynchronous programs with `asyncio`  
- Concurrent coroutines and task management  
- Using `random` in async workflows  

---

### 3. Python - Async Comprehension

Deep dive into asynchronous iteration with asynchronous generators and async comprehensions. Learn how to write async generators, use async comprehensions for elegant asynchronous iteration, and properly type-annotate asynchronous functions and generators.

**Key Topics:**

- Writing asynchronous generators  
- Async comprehensions for concise async iteration  
- Type annotations for asynchronous generators and coroutines  

---

## General Requirements

- All code is written and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.9.  
- Code style follows `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.5.x).  
- All files start with the shebang line: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.  
- All files end with a newline and are executable.  
- Full documentation is provided for all modules, classes, functions, and coroutines.  
- Type annotations are used throughout all functions and coroutines.  
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.

## Repository Structure

Each project contains its own set of Python scripts along with testing mains and supporting files. A README file is included in each project folder for detailed instructions and objectives.
