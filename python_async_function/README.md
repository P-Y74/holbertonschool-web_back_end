# Python - Async

This project explores asynchronous programming in Python using the `async` and `await` syntax and the `asyncio` module. It is designed to help you master writing concurrent code efficiently, enabling you to build high-performance applications.

---

## üöÄ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand and use `async` and `await` syntax.
- Execute asynchronous programs using the `asyncio` module.
- Run concurrent coroutines to perform multiple operations simultaneously.
- Create and manage `asyncio` tasks.
- Utilize the `random` module effectively within asynchronous code.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- All Python files must:
  - Begin with the shebang line: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - End with a newline.
  - Be executable.
  - Follow the `pycodestyle` style guidelines (version 2.5.x).
  - Include proper documentation for all modules, functions, and coroutines.
  - Use full type annotations on all functions and coroutines.

- Environment:
  - Code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
  - Python version: 3.9.

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.

## üè´ About

This project is part of the **Full Stack Web Development** curriculum at **Holberton School**.

It is focused on teaching asynchronous programming paradigms in Python, a crucial skill for modern software development where handling I/O-bound and high-latency operations efficiently is key.

Mastering async code will improve your ability to write scalable, performant applications.
