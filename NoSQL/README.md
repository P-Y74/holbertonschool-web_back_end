# NoSQL Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on working with NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB. By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand what NoSQL is and the differences between SQL and NoSQL.
- Explain ACID properties and document storage.
- Identify the types and benefits of NoSQL databases.
- Query, insert, update, and delete information in a NoSQL database.
- Use MongoDB effectively with Python (PyMongo).

All MongoDB scripts are designed to run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with MongoDB 4.4. Python scripts use Python 3.9 with PyMongo 4.8.0, following `pycodestyle` guidelines.

---

## Requirements

### MongoDB Command Files
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using MongoDB 4.4.
- Files must end with a new line.
- First line of all files: `// my comment`.

### Python Scripts
- Python 3.9 with PyMongo 4.8.0.
- Files must end with a new line.
- First line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (v2.5.*).
- Modules and functions must have proper documentation.
- Scripts must not execute code when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

## Style and Documentation
- All modules include descriptive docstrings.
- All functions include docstrings explaining their purpose and usage.
- Type annotations are used consistently in Python scripts.
- Python scripts are designed to be import-safe (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).

---

## Usage
To run a Python script, use:

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
```

To run a MongoDB command file, use the mongo shell:

```bash
mongo <command_file>
```
